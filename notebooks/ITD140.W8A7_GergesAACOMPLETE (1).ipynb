    "The goal of this assignment is to provide an introduction to the application of supervised machine learning algorithms. The assignment assumes the student has mastered the contnent of a college level basic statistics course, has completed or is concurrently enrolled in a Python programming course, or has completed another modern language programming course and has the skills required to consult Python programming documentation to complete the tasks. The assignment is designed to allow the student to understand and explore the dataset used for the remainder of the class, and practice and troubleshoot Python and Jupyter Notebook mechanics."
